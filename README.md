The Daily card draw that can be used by all servers to find card draws each day at 00:00UTC. This will hopefully get rid of the need to download 21 day calendars or have to guess where a drawing will be


This bot tells the daily cupons for a city depending on the day. It changes cupons at reset much like the game does. 

This project was made quickly to work for a specific case. But as more people and servers want to use this, I have started working on a more unified and better way for these servers to load in their own data. 

The code from this is then put into apps after a working version can be made. Though, other servers just use the Colaboratory.
